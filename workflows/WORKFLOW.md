This repo collects all team briefs, architecture notes, and design docs for Voclio.
Focus is on clean architecture, responsive design, and smooth UX across mobile, web, and backend.
Each module (AI, Backend, Flutter app, Web Dashboard) is isolated but works together seamlessly.
The repo acts as the single source of truth for roles, responsibilities, and integration points.
Goal: deliver a voice-first, AI-powered productivity app that feels simple and adaptive
